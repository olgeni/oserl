OSERL 3.2.4 needs common_lib 3.3.0 or higher.

Documentation available in man format:

   erl -man doc/man/oserl.1
   erl -man doc/man/gen_esme.3

Or any other module.

There are also two examples under doc/examples.

This version of oserl contains some extensions for the MAM2G interface used
by Vodafone (Quinary):

   - SUBMIT_MT
   - SUBMIT_CARING

RECHARGE_MT and ACCOUNT_INFO are not currently implemented, but if you grep
for MAM2G in the source it should give you a start.
